		<div class="col-lg answer">Yes, we are fully licensed and certified in Virginia as a Class A, BLD Contractor.

    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">Does Gilligan Contracting provide free estimates?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Yes, we provide initial consultations free of charge, but will charge a fee for creative and design services. For smaller jobs, we incorporate this expense into the contract and overall project price.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">How long are Gilligan Contracting estimates valid?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">The signed proposals are valid for 90 days after the date of issue. If it has been longer than that, we will be glad to refresh the quote.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">How important is it to choose a licensed contractor?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">It is very important as the market is flooded with unlicensed contractors who can exploit the unsuspecting customer. The purpose of licensing contractors is to protect the public, increase the quality standards of the profession and provide some recourse if a project goes bad. VDOPOR has established rigorous criteria and different certifications to prevent under qualified individuals from offering services as a contractor.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">What is contained in a Gilligan Contracting proposal?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Our contracts are very detailed, with specific line items defining the complete scope of work, anticipated materials and the labor expected to successfully complete the project on schedule and to agreed upon customer specifications.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">Can I change the scope of a project after it has begun?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Of course, just request a change-order which will serve as an addendum to the base contract and will detail the specific elements of the change. A change order will delineate cost increase or decrease, and can usually be provided within hours so as to not delay the project progress. There is a $125 fee for all change orders.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">Should I be concerned if a contractor wants to start the work without a written agreement?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Yes, you should be VERY concerned. It is illegal in the state of Virginia to perform contracting work without a written agreement. Contracts provide legal protections for both the customer and the service provider, but more importantly they provide a common framework of understanding of the terms of service.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">Is the lowest price always the best price?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Generally, if it looks too good to be true, it usually is. Many times, Gilligan Contracting finds that our competitors neglect or overlook important line items –- if they include them at all. Sometimes they may offer less experienced or unqualified labor, or base their estimates on undefined variables or significantly lower quality materials. We highly encourage you to perform reference checks on any contractors before signing a contract.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">How should I go about checking references before I select a contractor?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Do not hesitate to ask for references before signing an agreement. With Gilligan Contracting you can check our testimonials page, but if you prefer we would be glad to introduce you to past customers.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">What is an “allowance” and does Gilligan Contracting use them?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">An allowance is a specific contingency line-item to account for unpredictable variables in some complicated projects. We may occasionally use an allowance; however, we prefer to define the scope of each line item exactly so that our clients know precisely what they are agreeing to in a contract.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">What should I do if I find I have hired an unscrupulous or unqualified contractor?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Stop the project as soon as possible. Do not be afraid to say NO. It is your home.  You may also want to report them to the Better Business Bureau.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">When is a permit required?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">The situation varies by location, but a general rule is that if you are moving structural components, installing new plumbing or modifying electrical fixtures you will need a permit from the appropriate authority prior to beginning the project.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-4 question">Does Gilligan Contracting obtain the required permits?</div>
		<div class="col-lg answer">Yes, if required, we will obtain the necessary permits and approvals from the appropriate authority prior to beginning any project.</div>
